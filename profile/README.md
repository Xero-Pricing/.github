## What is Borderless Gaming?

**Borderless Gaming** is an essential utility for modern PC gamers, streamers, and multitaskers. It seamlessly converts games running in standard fullscreen or windowed mode into a sophisticated **borderless windowed mode**. This transformation is crucial for users who demand fluid transitions between their game and other desktop applications, such as web browsers, communication tools like Discord, or streaming software like OBS. Unlike traditional fullscreen mode, which often introduces significant delays, visual glitches, or even temporary freezes when alt-tabbing, borderless windowed mode maintains the game in a stable, always-accessible window that behaves like any other application on your desktop. This eliminates the frustrating performance drops and interruptions, providing a buttery-smooth experience for anyone who needs to access other programs without minimizing or pausing their game.

The software's robust compatibility extends to a vast library of PC games, from indie titles to AAA blockbusters. It has become particularly indispensable for games like **Minecraft**, where players frequently check wikis or guides, and for graphically intensive games like **Metro Exodus**, where users want the visual fidelity of fullscreen without the alt-tab penalty. By automating the often complex process of forcing a game into a borderless state, Borderless Gaming ensures that players can focus entirely on their immersion and gameplay. Its foundation as a free, open-source project on GitHub means it is continuously refined by a community of developers and users, making it a transparent, trustworthy, and reliable tool that respects user privacy and freedom. It is the definitive solution for achieving a seamless, borderless fullscreen experience.
